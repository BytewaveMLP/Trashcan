# Trashcan

> Throw away your useless items

## Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/BytewaveMLP/Trashcan/releases), and drop the `.jar` in your
server's plugin directory.

## Usage

Right click on a cauldron to open the trashcan UI. As soon as the inventory is closed, all items are permanently
deleted, so be careful!

Server operators (or users with the `trashcan.anywhere` permission) can open the trashcan at any time by using `/trash`.
